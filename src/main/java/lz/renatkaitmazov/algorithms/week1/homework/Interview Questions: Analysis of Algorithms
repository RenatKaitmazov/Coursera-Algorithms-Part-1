Question 1:
3-SUM in quadratic time.
Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n^2 in the worst case.
You may assume that you can sort the n integers in time proportional to n^2 or better.

Solution:
Sort the array with integers.
For each pair of integers find the third one such that a + b + c = 0
using binary search algorithm (it makes use of the fact that the array is sorted).

Question 2:
Search in a bitonic array.
An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately
by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of n distinct
integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

Solution 2:

Question 3:
Egg drop.
Suppose that you have an n-story building (with floors 1 through n) and plenty of eggs.
An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not break otherwise.
Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of T given the following
limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:

Version 0: 1 egg, ≤T tosses.
Version 1: ∼1lgn eggs and ∼1lgn tosses.
Version 2: ∼lgT eggs and ∼2lgT tosses.
Version 3: 2 eggs and ∼2√n tosses.
Version 4: 2 eggs and ≤c√T tosses for some fixed constant c.
